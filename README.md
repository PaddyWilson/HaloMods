# Instructions
Your modded map files go into **ModsLocationFolder\Mods\Halo Reach\Maps\\**.

When you first run the program it will setup some folders in your MCC install folder. If MCC is not installed at the default location you can browse to where ever you have it installed in the setting tab also change the mods location too.

Your modded maps go into your ModsLocation\Mods\Halo Reach\Maps folder. It does not matter what the names of the map files are. Whenever you add maps restart the program.

Pick a map from the vanilla maps list and modded maps list. The "Swap To Modded" button will swap the modded map with the vanilla one. "Load with quick switch" is used with the "Vanilla" and "Modded" buttons at the top so you don't have to pick out the maps to swap every time the program loads.

"Other files to mod" can be used for example with the haloreach.dll or the armour unlock file. Just locate the original and modded versions and click "Mod" or "Load with quick switch". If you used the "Mod" button the original files will be restored on exit of the program.
