# Instructions
When you first run the program it will setup some folders in your MCC install folder. If MCC is not installed at the default location you can browse to where ever you have it installed in the setting tab. The mods location has to be on the same drive as MCC.

Your modded map files go into **ModsLocationFolder\Mods\Halo Reach\Maps\\** folder. It does not matter what the names of the map files are. You can open this folder from the Halo Reach tab.

Pick a map from the vanilla maps list and modded maps list. The "Swap To Modded" button will swap the modded map with the vanilla one. "Load with quick switch" is used with the "Vanilla" and "Modded" buttons at the top so you don't have to pick out the maps to swap every time the program loads. This list is save automatically.

"Other files to mod" can be used for example with the haloreach.dll or the armour unlock file. Just locate the original and modded versions and click "Mod" or "Load with quick switch". If you used the "Mod" button the original files will be restored on exit of the program.
